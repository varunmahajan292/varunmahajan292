### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" alt="" width="30px"/>, I am Varun Mahajan!

I am an experienced **Software Developer** who constantly seeks out innovative solutions to everyday problems. In my 3+ years in this industry, I've honed my analytical thinking and collaboration skills, and I love working with a team. Currently, I am working as a Software Developer with a reputed organization.

In the next 10 years, I'd like to move into a Chief Technology Officer role. A position like this senior software engineer job would let me gain more experience with project management and leadership.
